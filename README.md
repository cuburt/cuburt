### 🧠 AI Researcher | Machine Learning Engineer | Generative AI Specialist

I am a Master’s in Information Technology graduate focused on the frontier of generative modeling and decision science. My current work centers on optimizing **SLM/LLM scalability** and advancing **Diffusion Transformers (DiT) Post-Training** pipelines, alongside a deep foundation in Bayesian methodologies like Gaussian Process Regression.

### 🚀 Technical Focus
* **LLMs & SLMs:** Designing robust pipelines for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align models with complex reasoning tasks.
* **Bayesian Forecasting:** Leveraging Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for uncertainty-aware predictions in high-stakes environments like infrastructure management.
* **Time-Series Hybridization:** Combining classical VARIMA models with Deep Learning (MLP) for multi-variable forecasting.
* **Diffusion Transformers (DiT):** Investigating scalable transformer-based backbones for latent diffusion, moving beyond U-Net architectures for higher-fidelity generation.
* **RAG Systems:** Developing Multimodal RAG architectures capable of synthesizing insights from variant data sources, including structured tables, unstructured text, and visual assets, utilizing cross-modal embeddings for holistic retrieval.
* **Post-Training & Alignment:** Engineering iterative workflows for model distillation and preference alignment to optimize Small Language Models (SLMs) for efficient, local, resource-constrained inference.
